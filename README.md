# MSP430_learning

To start developing embedded systems using Texas Instruments' wide variety of microcontrollers, I'm applying microcontroller programming concepts, starting with the basics,
such as the use of IOs and timers, and gradually exploring the other features available on the development boards that I have access.

I'm using the Ubuntu 22.04 terminal to compile and debug the programs.
To start my studies, I followed the initial steps I read on Sergio Prado's blog (https://sergioprado.org/trabalhando-com-o-msp430-no-linux/).
